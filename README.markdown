### Description
An Arduino based clock and thermometer  
  
This project uses a Dallas DS18B20 and a DS1307 RTC to track the current time and temperature.
The system outputs the sensor data to an RGB LCD which is fully user configurable at runtime.
Also the setup has a Simple RF board to control which sensor data to display on the LCD using an external pin interrupt to quickly switch between the two.
